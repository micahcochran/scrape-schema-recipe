# Test Data Attribution/Licenses

Attribution for the test data included in this python package (located in the [`scrape_schema_recipe/test_data/`](scrape_schema_recipe/test_data/) folder). 
These are input for testing the software package.

I've tried to use recipes under Creative Commons Licenses that do not restrict a derivative work because
in the strictest sense a unit test case could be considered a derivative work.
However, I think that using a recipe for testing software constitutes fair use.

These recipes and their HTML remain are licensed under their respective licenses, 
NOT the Apache 2.0 license that the software is licensed (except where noted).
